## Benefits of Batch Normalization

Batch normalization optimizes network training. It has been shown to have several benefits:

1. Networks train faster – Each training iteration will actually be slower because of the extra calculations during the forward pass and the additional hyperparameters to train during back propagation. However, it should converge much more quickly, so training should be faster overall.

2. Allows higher learning rates – Gradient descent usually requires small learning rates for the network to converge. And as networks get deeper, their gradients get smaller during back propagation so they require even more iterations. Using batch normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates, which further 
increases the speed at which networks train.

3. Makes weights easier to initialize – Weight initialization can be difficult, and it's even more difficult when creating deeper networks. Batch normalization seems to allow us to be much less careful about choosing our initial starting weights.

4. Makes more activation functions viable – Some activation functions do not work well in some situations. Sigmoids lose their gradient pretty quickly, which means they can't be used in deep networks. And ReLUs often die out during training, where they stop learning completely, so we need to be careful about the range of values fed into them. Because batch normalization regulates the values going into each activation function, non-linearlities that don't seem to work well in deep networks actually become viable again.

5. Simplifies the creation of deeper networks – Because of the first 4 items listed above, it is easier to build and faster to train deeper neural networks when using batch normalization. And it's been shown that deeper networks generally produce better results, so that's great.

6. Provides a bit of regularization – Batch normalization adds a little noise to your network. In some cases, such as in Inception modules, batch normalization has been shown to work as well as dropout. But in general, consider batch normalization as a bit of extra regularization, possibly allowing you to reduce some of the dropout you might add to a network.

7. May give better results overall – Some tests seem to show batch normalization actually improves the training results. However, it's really an optimization to help train faster, so you shouldn't think of it as a way to make your network better. But since it lets you train networks faster, that means you can iterate over more designs more quickly. It also lets you build deeper networks, which are usually better. So when you factor in everything, you're probably going to end up with better results if you build your networks with batch normalization.
